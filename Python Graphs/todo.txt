- fix data structures/runtime of certain parts of the program
    - use linked lists, require O(1) append time for 2 lists, not possible with
      pythons array implementation (amortized O(n) insertion time for n items
      means that this is probably the only issue caused by this)
    - ensure that array and set runtimes are working correctly (unsure of
      implementation used by python)

- finish ICD testing function for some set of edges and any algorithm

- work on efficient digraph generation with control over density and size or
  come up with some other method to test the algorithms
